# 🍌 Nano Banana

> *“This was never meant to be important.  
It simply became so.”*

Nano Banana is a lightweight, absurdly efficient AI-powered image generation project.  
It was created as a side experiment, ignored deliberately, and optimized in the shadows.

No hype. No noise. Only results.

---

## 🕶 Philosophy

Nano Banana follows three principles:

- **Minimal surface, maximum impact**
- **Function over explanation**
- **Power hidden behind simplicity**

If something looks simple here, assume it was made that way on purpose.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ⚡ Ultra-fast AI image generation  
- 🧠 Prompt-to-image pipeline with minimal overhead  
- 🍃 Lightweight structure (no bloated dependencies)  
- 🛠 Easily extendable for automation and custom workflows  
- 🎭 Clean UI with shadow-grade efficiency  

Nothing unnecessary survives.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Node.js  
- AI: API-based image generation  
- Design philosophy: *Invisible complexity*
